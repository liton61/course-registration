Question - 02 :

useState is a function in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, that allows you to add state to functional components. State in React is a way to store and manage data that can change over time, and it enables components to re-render when that data changes, updating the user interface as needed. useState is typically used within functional components to declare and manage a piece of state.












# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
